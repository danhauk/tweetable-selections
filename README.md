Tweetable Selections WordPress Plugin
=======================

A small WordPress plugin to make it easy for users to highlight and tweet pieces of your article.

When a reader of your site highlights text on an article, a small tooltip pops up asking if they want to post to Twitter. If the reader clicks it, a Twitter tweet intent window pops open pre-populated with the highlighted text in quotes, link to the article, and your username.
